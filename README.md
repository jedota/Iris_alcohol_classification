# Alcohol Consumption Detection from Periocular NIR Images Using Capsule Network
Juan Tapia, Enrique Lopez Droguett and Christoph Busch

# Description
This research proposes a method to detect alcohol consumption from a Near-Infra-Red (NIR) periocular eye images. The study focuses on determining the effect of external factors such as alcohol on the Central Nervous System (CNS). The goal is to analyse how this impacts on iris and pupil movements and if it is possible to capture these changes with a standard iris NIR camera. This paper proposes a novel Fused Capsule Network (F-CapsNet) to classify iris NIR images taken under alcohol consumption subjects. The results show the F-CapsNet algorithm can detect alcohol consumption in iris NIR images with an accuracy of 92.3% using half of parameters than the standard Capsule Network algorithm. This work is a step forward for developing an automatic system to estimate "Fitness for Duty" and prevent accidents due to alcohol consumption.

# Database

A total of 600 images of volunteers not under the influence of alcohol were captured and 2,400 images were taken after each volunteer had ingested 200 ml of alcohol (Images taken in intervals of 15 minutes after consumption). The database was divided into 70\% and 30\% for Training and Testing. The partition is a subject-disjoint database.

A health committee team evaluated the captured process before it started. A consent form was used to capture images for all the volunteers as requested by the health committee.
ICPR 2022 - Data will available in the next days
